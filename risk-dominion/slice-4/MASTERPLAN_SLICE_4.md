# RISK: DOMINION — SLICE 4 MASTERPLAN

## Version 1.0
## Scope: Query System, Event Ticker, Autocomplete — Final Slice
## Target: Claude Code Generation — Modifying the Slice 3 Codebase

---

## 0. DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document specifies how to modify the working Slice 3 codebase to add the query system, event ticker, and Tab autocomplete. Read this document in full. Read the existing Slice 3 codebase. Apply the changes specified here.

Do not regenerate Slice 3. Do not create a new project. Modify the existing files in place. Mark each output file as MODIFIED or NEW.

This is the final slice. After this, Risk: Dominion is feature-complete.

---

## 1. BEFORE YOU BEGIN

Read every existing file in the Slice 3 codebase:
- `slice-1/server/Cargo.toml`
- `slice-1/server/src/lib.rs`
- `slice-1/client/src/App.tsx`
- `slice-1/client/src/constants.ts`
- `slice-1/client/src/types.ts`
- `slice-1/client/src/hooks/useSubscriptions.ts`
- `slice-1/client/src/utils/territoryHelpers.ts`
- `slice-1/client/src/components/Map.tsx`
- `slice-1/client/src/components/Territory.tsx`
- `slice-1/client/src/components/CardHand.tsx`
- `slice-1/client/src/components/ActionCard.tsx`
- `slice-1/client/src/components/IntelPanel.tsx`
- `slice-1/client/src/components/ActionBar.tsx`
- `slice-1/client/src/components/VictoryScreen.tsx`

Understand the current code before making any changes. Then apply the modifications in this document in the order specified.

---

## 2. FILE LIST

## 4. SERVER MODIFICATIONS

### 4.1 New Table

Add to the TABLES section:

```rust
#[spacetimedb(table)]
struct EventFeed {
    id: i32,
    timestamp: i64,
    event_text: String,
    territory_id: Option<i32>,
    player_id: Option<i32>,
    event_type: String, // 'military' | 'economic' | 'cultural' | 'covert' | 'victory' | 'system'
}
```

Use `#[autoinc]` for `id` if SpacetimeDB supports it. `territory_id` and `player_id` are nullable (use `Option<i32>`).

### 4.2 Event Writes in Existing Reducers

Every reducer that changes game state must write an `EventFeed` row as its **last operation**. The event insert happens after the primary state change has succeeded.

**Error handling:** Wrap the event insert in a result handler. If it fails, log the error to the server console. Do NOT return the error to the client. Do NOT roll back the game state change. Events are fire-and-forget.

#### `start_game`

After all seed data is inserted:

```rust
EventFeed {
    id: 0, // auto-increment
    timestamp: (current server time in ms),
    event_text: "Game started. Four factions vie for control.".to_string(),
    territory_id: None,
    player_id: None,
    event_type: "system".to_string(),
}
```

#### `military_attack`

After a successful flip (ownership changed):

```rust
EventFeed {
    timestamp: (current server time in ms),
    event_text: format!("{} seized military control of {} from {}.", attacker_name, territory_name, defender_name),
    territory_id: Some(territory_id),
    player_id: Some(attacker_id),
    event_type: "military".to_string(),
}
```

After a repelled attack (ownership unchanged):

```rust
EventFeed {
    timestamp: (current server time in ms),
    event_text: format!("{}'s attack on {} was repelled by {}.", attacker_name, territory_name, defender_name),
    territory_id: Some(territory_id),
    player_id: Some(defender_id),
    event_type: "military".to_string(),
}
```

Use the `players` table to get names from IDs. Use the territory constants to get territory names.

#### `economic_invest`

After an ownership flip:

```rust
EventFeed {
    timestamp: (current server time in ms),
    event_text: format!("{} gained economic control of {} from {}.", player_name, territory_name, old_owner_name),
    territory_id: Some(territory_id),
    player_id: Some(player_id),
    event_type: "economic".to_string(),
}
```

After investment with no flip:

```rust
EventFeed {
    timestamp: (current server time in ms),
    event_text: format!("{} invested in {}. Capital now {}.", player_name, territory_name, new_capital),
    territory_id: Some(territory_id),
    player_id: Some(player_id),
    event_type: "economic".to_string(),
}
```

#### `deploy_agent`

After agent deployment:

```rust
EventFeed {
    timestamp: (current server time in ms),
    event_text: format!("{} deployed an agent in {}.", player_name, territory_name),
    territory_id: Some(territory_id),
    player_id: Some(player_id),
    event_type: "covert".to_string(),
}
```

#### `cultural_spread_tick`

Inside the loop, after a cultural flip (ownership changed):

```rust
EventFeed {
    timestamp: (current server time in ms),
    event_text: format!("{}'s cultural influence spread to {}, displacing {}.", new_owner_name, territory_name, old_owner_name),
    territory_id: Some(territory_id),
    player_id: Some(new_owner_id),
    event_type: "cultural".to_string(),
}
```

#### `dimension_owner_change`

After the win check, if the territory became newly unified (all four dimensions same owner):

```rust
EventFeed {
    timestamp: (current server time in ms),
    event_text: format!("{} unified {} — {} of 5 toward victory.", player_name, territory_name, unified_count),
    territory_id: Some(territory_id),
    player_id: Some(player_id),
    event_type: "victory".to_string(),
}
```

If the win check returns true (game over):

```rust
EventFeed {
    timestamp: (current server time in ms),
    event_text: format!("{} wins! All five territories unified.", winner_name),
    territory_id: None,
    player_id: Some(winner_id),
    event_type: "victory".to_string(),
}
```

#### `ai_reasoning_cycle`

In the timeout branch (30 seconds elapsed):

```rust
EventFeed {
    timestamp: (current server time in ms),
    event_text: format!("{}'s command appears to be in disarray.", ai_name),
    territory_id: None,
    player_id: Some(ai_player_id),
    event_type: "system".to_string(),
}
```

### 4.3 New Reducers

All three new reducers use the same `std::thread::spawn` + `reqwest::blocking::Client` pattern as `ai_reasoning_cycle`. Multiple threads may run concurrently — this is expected and safe. SpacetimeDB serializes reducer calls, so each thread operates on a consistent snapshot.

#### `query_database(query: String)`

1. Build game state snapshot: all rows from military, economic, cultural, covert, players. Include adjacency map, territory names, unified counts.
2. Construct prompt:

```
You are a database query translator for the game Risk: Dominion. The game has 12 territories, 4 players (Player, Zhao, Consortium, Prophet), and 4 dimensions (Military, Economic, Cultural, Covert).

Current game state:
{full game state snapshot}

A player asks: "{query}"

Translate this into a structured response. Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact shape:
{
  "summary": "A clear one-sentence answer to the question.",
  "highlighted_territories": [territory_id, ...],
  "data_table": {
    "columns": ["Column Name", ...],
    "rows": [["value", ...], ...]
  }
}

Rules:
- summary: concise, informative. Use player names and territory names, not IDs.
- highlighted_territories: array of territory_ids most relevant. Empty array [] if none.
- data_table: use territory and player names in rows. Numbers can be raw. If no data, return empty columns and rows.
- If the query is unanswerable, set summary to "I couldn't understand that question. Try asking about territory ownership, player strength, or strategic positioning." and return empty arrays.
```

3. Spawn thread. Call Anthropic API. Temperature: 0.3. Max tokens: 500. Timeout: 10s.
4. Parse JSON response. Return it.
5. On any error: return `{ "summary": "Query processing failed. Try a canned query or rephrase your question.", "highlighted_territories": [], "data_table": { "columns": [], "rows": [] } }`.

#### `get_canned_query(query_id: i32)`

1. Validate query_id is 0–9.
2. Build same game state snapshot as `query_database`.
3. Select the pre-formulated prompt for this query_id (see Section 5).
4. Spawn thread. Call Anthropic API. Temperature: 0.3. Max tokens: 500. Timeout: 10s.
5. Parse and return same shape as `query_database`.
6. Same error fallback.

#### `autocomplete_query(partial: String)`

1. Build same game state snapshot.
2. Construct prompt:

```
The player has typed "{partial}" in the query bar of Risk: Dominion. The current game state is:

{full game state snapshot}

Suggest up to 3 intelligent completions for what the player might want to ask, based on the current game state. Consider the player's strategic position, which opponents are strongest, contested territories, and common strategic questions.

Return ONLY a JSON array of strings. Example: ["Where is Zhao strongest?", "Where is Zhao about to attack?", "Where is Zhao's cultural influence?"]

If the partial text is fewer than 3 characters, return an empty array [].
```

3. Spawn thread. Call Anthropic API. Temperature: 0.3. Max tokens: 150. Timeout: 5s.
4. Parse JSON array. Return `{ "suggestions": [...] }`.
5. On error: return `{ "suggestions": [] }`.

---

## 5. CANNED QUERY PROMPTS

Store these as constants in `lib.rs`. Each is a pre-formulated prompt string. The game state snapshot is appended to every prompt by the reducer.

**query_id 0:**
```
The player asks: "Where am I weakest?" Analyze the game state. For each territory, count how many of the four dimensions (military, economic, cultural, covert) are owned by the Player (player_id 1). Return territories where the Player owns the fewest dimensions, sorted with the weakest first. Return a summary sentence, an array of highlighted territory_ids, and a data_table with columns: Territory, Dimensions Controlled, Dimensions Lost, Strongest Opponent.
```

**query_id 1:**
```
The player asks: "Show contested territories." Analyze the game state. For each territory, count how many distinct players own at least one dimension there. Return territories with 3 or more distinct owners. Return a summary sentence, an array of highlighted territory_ids, and a data_table with columns: Territory, Number of Factions, Owners.
```

**query_id 2:**
```
The player asks: "Where is Zhao about to attack?" Zhao is player_id 2. Find territories adjacent to Zhao's military-controlled territories where Zhao does NOT already own the Military dimension. Return a summary sentence, an array of highlighted territory_ids, and a data_table with columns: Territory, Current Military Owner, Zhao's Adjacent Troops.
```

**query_id 3:**
```
The player asks: "Which territories are closest to unification?" For each player, count how many dimensions they own in each territory. Return territories where any player owns exactly 3 dimensions (one away from unifying all 4). Return a summary sentence, an array of highlighted territory_ids, and a data_table with columns: Territory, Player, Missing Dimension, Current Owner of Missing Dimension.
```

**query_id 4:**
```
The player asks: "Show my economic dominance." Return all territories where the Player (player_id 1) owns the Economic dimension. Sort by capital descending. Return a summary sentence including total capital across all owned territories, an array of highlighted territory_ids, and a data_table with columns: Territory, Your Capital, Runner-Up Capital, Margin.
```

**query_id 5:**
```
The player asks: "Where is my covert presence too thin?" Find territories where the Player has 0 agents (covert.owner_id != 1 or agent_count = 0) but where AI opponents have military or economic presence. Return a summary sentence, an array of highlighted territory_ids, and a data_table with columns: Territory, Dominant Opponent, Opponent Military, Opponent Economic.
```

**query_id 6:**
```
The player asks: "What is the Consortium's strongest dimension?" The Consortium is player_id 3. Count how many territories the Consortium owns for each of the four dimensions. Return the dimension with the highest count. Return a summary sentence naming the dimension and count, an array of highlighted territory_ids where the Consortium owns that dimension, and a data_table with columns: Dimension, Territories Controlled, Percentage of Map.
```

**query_id 7:**
```
The player asks: "Where is cultural influence spreading fastest?" Find territories where the Cultural owner is different from the territory's Military or Economic owner, sorted by influence_pct descending. Return a summary sentence, an array of highlighted territory_ids (top 5), and a data_table with columns: Territory, Cultural Owner, Influence %, Territory Military Owner.
```

**query_id 8:**
```
The player asks: "Show me territories with cross-dimension bonuses." For the Player (player_id 1), find territories where the Player owns at least 2 of the 4 dimensions. For each, list which dimensions the Player owns and which bonuses are active (Military->Economic +1 invest, Economic->Cultural +15% pressure, Cultural->Covert +10% effective agents, Covert->Military +agent_count to attack). Return a summary sentence, an array of highlighted territory_ids, and a data_table with columns: Territory, Dimensions Owned, Active Bonuses.
```

**query_id 9:**
```
The player asks: "Who is winning?" Count unified territories (all 4 dimensions owned by the same player) for each player. A territory is unified when military.owner_id, economic.owner_id, cultural.owner_id, and covert.owner_id are all the same player. Return a summary sentence naming the leader and their count, an array of highlighted territory_ids for all unified territories, and a data_table with columns: Player, Unified Territories, Territory Names, Progress (X/5).
```

export interface EventFeedRow {
  id: number;
  timestamp: number;
  event_text: string;
  territory_id: number | null;
  player_id: number | null;

  data_table: {
    columns: string[];
    rows: string[][];
  };
}

export interface AutocompleteResult {
  suggestions: string[];
}
```

### 6.3 `useSubscriptions.ts` (MODIFIED)

Add subscription:

```typescript
const eventFeed = useSubscription<EventFeedRow[]>('subscribe_event_feed');
```

Include `eventFeed` in the returned object.

### 6.4 `EventTicker.tsx` (NEW)

**Position:** Fixed bar at the very bottom of the viewport, below the card hand. Height: 28px. Background: `#0D0D1A`. Top border: 1px solid `#334455`.

**Props:** `events: EventFeedRow[]`, `onEventClick: (territoryId: number | null) => void`, `playerColors: Record<number, string>`.

**Rendering:**
- Take the last 50 events from the `events` array. Slice client-side: `events.slice(-50)`.
- Render them as a single scrolling line. Events scroll from right to left continuously. Linear CSS animation, approximately 30px per second.
- Each event in the line consists of:
  - An icon: a small geometric SVG shape (12x12px) based on `event_type`:
    - `military`: upward-pointing triangle (same as the Military card icon, scaled down).
    - `economic`: circle with vertical line (same as Economic card icon, scaled down).
    - `cultural`: a diamond shape (rotated square).
    - `covert`: concentric circles (same as Covert card icon, scaled down).
    - `victory`: a small hexagon outline.
    - `system`: a small dash or horizontal line.
    All icons are monochrome, colored `text-secondary` (#8899AA).
  - A colored square indicator (8×8px, 2px border radius) filled with the player's color from `playerColors`. If `player_id` is null, use gray (`#555555`).
  - The `event_text` string in JetBrains Mono, 11px, `text-primary` (#E0E0E0).
- Events are separated by a middot character (·) in `text-secondary` with 8px spacing on each side.

**Interaction:**
- CSS `animation-play-state: paused` on hover.
- `onClick` on each event: calls `onEventClick(event.territory_id)`.
- Cursor pointer on hover.

**Implementation:** Use a container with `overflow: hidden` and an inner container that translates horizontally. The inner container's width is determined by the total length of all event texts. CSS `@keyframes scroll` with `transform: translateX(-100%)` over a duration proportional to the content width.

### 6.5 `QueryBar.tsx` (NEW)

**Position:** Top of the screen, full width. Background: `bg-surface` (#1A1A2E). Bottom border: 1px `#334455`. Height: auto (expands with content).

**Props:** `onQuerySubmit: (query: string) => void`, `onCannedQuery: (queryId: number) => void`, `onAutocomplete: (partial: string) => void`, `autocompleteSuggestions: string[]`, `isLoading: boolean`.

**Layout:**
- Top row: a gold `>` prompt character in JetBrains Mono, 14px, `#FFD700`, followed by a text input field. The input has no border, no outline, transparent background, JetBrains Mono 13px, `text-primary`. Placeholder: "Ask anything about the game state..." in `text-secondary` (#8899AA). Full remaining width.
- Second row: 10 pill-shaped buttons in two rows of five. Each pill: height 24px, padding 6px 12px, border-radius 12px, background `bg-surface-alt` (#222240), text Orbitron 11px `text-secondary`. Hover: border 1px `#FFD700`, text becomes `text-primary`. Labels from `CANNED_QUERY_LABELS`.

**Tab Autocomplete:**
- On `onKeyDown`, if key is Tab:
  - `event.preventDefault()`.
  - Call `onAutocomplete(currentInputValue)`.
- When `autocompleteSuggestions` is non-empty, render a dropdown directly below the input:
  - Dark background `bg-surface`, border 1px `#334455`, border-radius 4px.
  - Each suggestion is a row: JetBrains Mono, 12px, `text-primary`, padding 6px 12px.
  - Hovered row: background `bg-surface-alt`.
  - Clicking a suggestion fills the input and closes the dropdown.
  - Pressing Escape closes the dropdown.
  - Pressing Tab while dropdown is open cycles through suggestions.

**Query Submission:**
- On Enter key: call `onQuerySubmit(currentInputValue)`. Clear the input.
- While `isLoading` is true: show a subtle loading indicator (a thin pulsing progress bar at the bottom of the input, or three pulsing dots to the right of the input).

**Canned Query Click:**
- Each pill button calls `onCannedQuery(queryId)` on click.

### 6.6 `ResultsPanel.tsx` (NEW)

**Position:** Between the query bar and the map. Slides down with a 250ms ease-out transition.

**Props:** `result: QueryResult | null`, `onClose: () => void`.

**Rendering (when `result` is not null):**
- Container: `bg-surface` (#1A1A2E) at 95% opacity. Border: 1px `#334455`. Border-radius: 4px. Margin: 8px.
- Close button: small "×" in top-right corner. Orbitron, 16px, `text-secondary`. Hover: `text-primary`. onClick calls `onClose`.
- Summary row: `result.summary` in Orbitron, 14px, `text-primary`. Padding: 8px 12px. Bottom border: 1px `#334455`.
- Data table:
  - Column headers from `result.data_table.columns`: Orbitron, 11px, `text-accent` (#FFD700). Padding: 6px 12px.
  - Rows from `result.data_table.rows`: JetBrains Mono, 12px, `text-primary`. Alternating backgrounds: `bg-surface` and `bg-surface-alt` (#222240). Cell padding: 6px 12px.
  - Row bottom border: 0.5px `#334455`.
  - Clicking a column header sorts the table by that column client-side (toggle ascending/descending). Indicate sort direction with a small arrow.

**Empty state:** If `result.data_table.rows` is empty, show only the summary text with extra padding. No empty table grid.

**When `result` is null:** Component renders nothing (hidden).

### 6.7 `Map.tsx` (MODIFIED)

**Props:** Add `tickerHighlight: number | null`.

**Highlight rendering:**
- `highlightedTerritories` (from queries): existing gold glow behavior from prior slices. Persistent until cleared.
- `tickerHighlight` (from event click): white or light gold pulse. Use a CSS animation: `@keyframes pulse-highlight { 0%, 100% { box-shadow: 0 0 0px rgba(255,255,255,0); } 50% { box-shadow: 0 0 12px 4px rgba(255,255,255,0.4); } }`. Duration 3s, then removed.
- If both apply to the same territory, render both effects (gold glow + white pulse).

Pass `tickerHighlight` to each `Territory` as `isTickerHighlighted={territory_id === tickerHighlight}`.

### 6.8 `App.tsx` (MODIFIED)

**Layout changes:**
- Import and render `QueryBar` at the top of the screen.
- Import and render `ResultsPanel` between `QueryBar` and `Map` (conditional on `queryResult` not null).
- Import and render `EventTicker` at the very bottom, below `CardHand`.
- Layout order (top to bottom): QueryBar, ResultsPanel (conditional), Map, CardHand, EventTicker.
- IntelPanel remains on the left side. ActionBar remains top-right.

**New state:**
```typescript
const [queryResult, setQueryResult] = useState<QueryResult | null>(null);
const [highlightedTerritories, setHighlightedTerritories] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [tickerHighlight, setTickerHighlight] = useState<number | null>(null);
const [autocompleteSuggestions, setAutocompleteSuggestions] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [isQueryLoading, setIsQueryLoading] = useState(false);
```

**Query handlers:**
- `handleQuerySubmit(query: string)`: set `isQueryLoading = true`. Call `query_database(query)`. On response, set `queryResult`, set `highlightedTerritories` from result, set `isQueryLoading = false`.
- `handleCannedQuery(queryId: number)`: same pattern, calls `get_canned_query(queryId)`.
- `handleAutocomplete(partial: string)`: calls `autocomplete_query(partial)`. On response, set `autocompleteSuggestions`.
- `handleCloseResults()`: set `queryResult = null`, set `highlightedTerritories = []`.

**Ticker handler:**
- `handleEventClick(territoryId: number | null)`: if `territoryId` is not null, set `tickerHighlight = territoryId`. Start a 3-second timer: `setTimeout(() => setTickerHighlight(null), 3000)`.

**Subscriptions:**
- `eventFeed` from `useSubscriptions`.

**Pass to components:**
- `QueryBar`: `onQuerySubmit`, `onCannedQuery`, `onAutocomplete`, `autocompleteSuggestions`, `isQueryLoading`.
- `ResultsPanel`: `result={queryResult}`, `onClose={handleCloseResults}`.
- `Map`: `highlightedTerritories`, `tickerHighlight`.
- `EventTicker`: `events={eventFeed}`, `onEventClick={handleEventClick}`, `playerColors={PLAYER_COLORS}`.

## 7. GENERATION RULES

1. **Modify existing files in place.** Read each file before modifying. Preserve all Slice 3 functionality not explicitly changed.
2. **Mark every output file** as MODIFIED or NEW at the top.
3. **All arithmetic is integer arithmetic.** No floats.
4. **SpacetimeDB macros:** `#[spacetimedb(table)]`, `#[spacetimedb(reducer)]`, `#[spacetimedb(scheduled)]`.
5. **Tailwind CSS for all styling.** Use design tokens from `../AESTHETIC.md`.
6. **No emojis. No em dashes. No custom CSS files.**
7. **Event ticker icons are geometric SVGs.** See AESTHETIC.md Section 13 for the icon design language.
8. **Query reducers use `std::thread::spawn` + `reqwest::blocking::Client`.** Same pattern as `ai_reasoning_cycle`.
9. **Event writes are fire-and-forget.** Wrap in result handler. Log errors. Never block the primary state change.
10. **This is the final slice.** Generate everything specified. No placeholders for future features.

---

## 8. WHAT NOT TO GENERATE

There are no future slices. Generate everything specified. Do not add:
- New dimensions
- New AI opponents
- New card types
- New gameplay mechanics
- Any system not specified in this document

---

## 9. SUCCESS CRITERIA

After applying all modifications, the Slice 4 application must:
