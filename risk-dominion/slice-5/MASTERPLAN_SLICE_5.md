# RISK: DOMINION — SLICE 5 MASTERPLAN

## Version 1.0
## Scope: Subagent Orchestration, Hotkeys, Human Strategist — Final Slice
## Target: Claude Code Generation — Modifying the Slice 4 Codebase

---

## 0. DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document specifies how to modify the working Slice 4 codebase to add subagent orchestration, keyboard controls, and the human Strategist advisor. Read this document in full. Read the existing Slice 4 codebase. Apply the changes specified here.

Do not regenerate Slice 4. Do not create a new project. Modify the existing files in place. Mark each output file as MODIFIED or NEW.

This is the final slice. After this, Risk: Dominion is complete.

---

## 1. BEFORE YOU BEGIN

Read every existing file in the Slice 4 codebase:
- `slice-1/server/Cargo.toml`
- `slice-1/server/src/lib.rs`
- `slice-1/client/src/App.tsx`
- `slice-1/client/src/constants.ts`
- `slice-1/client/src/types.ts`
- `slice-1/client/src/hooks/useSubscriptions.ts`
- `slice-1/client/src/utils/territoryHelpers.ts`
- `slice-1/client/src/components/Map.tsx`

## 4. SERVER MODIFICATIONS

### 4.1 Modified Table: `ai_reasoning_log`

Add a `subordinate_id` column:

```rust
struct AiReasoningLog {
    id: i32,
    ai_player_id: i32,
    cycle_at: i64,
    subordinate_id: String,  // NEW — default "commander"
    reasoning_text: String,
    actions_taken: String,
}
```

**Migration note:** If SpacetimeDB supports adding columns with defaults, use `DEFAULT 'commander'`. If not, the new column applies to new rows only. The `get_intel` reducer must handle rows where `subordinate_id` is missing by treating them as `"commander"`.

### 4.2 New Table: `strategist_log`

```rust
#[spacetimedb(table)]
struct StrategistLog {
    id: i32,
    timestamp: i64,
    notification: String,
    priority: String, // 'critical' | 'warning' | 'info'
    territory_id: Option<i32>,
    player_id: Option<i32>,
    dismissed: bool,
}
```

Default `dismissed = false`. Use `#[autoinc]` for `id` if supported.

### 4.3 Restructured Reducer: `ai_reasoning_cycle(ai_player_id: INT)`

**Replace the entire body of this reducer.** Do not preserve the old single-call logic. The schedule and stagger remain unchanged (60s intervals, 20s offsets).

**New logic:**

1. If `ai_state.cycle_status == 'pending'` for this AI: skip. Return.
2. Set `cycle_status = 'pending'`.
3. `let cycle_at = current_time_ms()`.
4. Build four domain-specific game state snapshots:
   - **Military:** military table, adjacency map, covert table (for combat bonus), players table.
   - **Economic:** economic table, military table (for invest bonus), adjacency map, players table.
   - **Cultural:** cultural table, economic table (for pressure bonus), adjacency map, players table.
   - **Covert:** covert table, cultural table (for intel bonus), players table.
5. Select the four specialist prompts based on `ai_player_id` (see Section 5).
6. Spawn four `std::thread`s — one per specialist. Each thread:
   - Calls Claude with its domain snapshot and specialist prompt.
   - Temperature: 0.3. Max tokens: 150. Timeout: 15 seconds.
   - Returns a `SubordinateResult` struct on success, or an empty result on timeout/error.
7. Collect all four `JoinHandle`s. Call `join()` on each. Collect results into a `Vec<SubordinateResult>`.
8. Build the commander prompt (see Section 6). Include the full game state and all four specialist recommendations (or "No recommendation — specialist unavailable" for timeouts).
9. Spawn a commander thread. Temperature: 0.3. Max tokens: 500. Timeout: 30 seconds.
10. On commander response:
    - Parse the JSON action array.
    - Call `ai_submit_actions(ai_player_id, actions, commander_reasoning, cycle_at, subordinate_results)`.
11. On commander timeout or error:
    - Reset `cycle_status = 'idle'`.
    - Write timeout event to `event_feed`: `"{ai_name}'s command appears to be in disarray."`

### 4.4 Modified Reducer: `ai_submit_actions`

**New signature:**
```rust
fn ai_submit_actions(
    ai_player_id: i32,
    actions: Vec<Action>,
    commander_reasoning: String,
    cycle_at: i64,
    subordinate_results: Vec<SubordinateResult>
) -> Result<(), String>
```

Where:
```rust
struct SubordinateResult {
    subordinate_id: String,
    reasoning_text: String,
    recommendations: Vec<Action>,
}
```

**New behavior:**
1. Validate and execute actions as before (unchanged from Slice 2–4).
2. After updating `ai_state`:
   - Insert one `ai_reasoning_log` row per subordinate result (including empty ones for timeouts).
   - Insert the commander row last with the final `actions_taken` JSON.
   - All rows share the same `cycle_at` and `ai_player_id`.
   - Each row has the appropriate `subordinate_id`.

### 4.5 Modified Reducer: `get_intel(ai_player_id: INT)`

**New return structure.** Replace the single `intel_text` field with a `deliberation` array:

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "ai_player_name": "Zhao",
    "cycle_timestamp": 1717628400,
    "deliberation": [
        {
            "subordinate_id": "vanguard",
            "subordinate_name": "Vanguard",
            "role": "Military Specialist",
            "reasoning": "Brazil is vulnerable. Player has only 4 troops. We have 8 troops adjacent. Recommend attack.",
            "recommendations": [{"action_type": "military_attack", "territory_id": 4}]
        },
        {
            "subordinate_id": "commander",
            "subordinate_name": "Zhao",
            "role": "Commander",
            "reasoning": "All subordinates concur. Executing military strike on Brazil.",
            "recommendations": [{"action_type": "military_attack", "territory_id": 4}]
        }
    ],
    "territories_referenced": [4]
}
```

- Query `ai_reasoning_log` for the most recent `cycle_at` for this AI. Return all rows with that `cycle_at`, ordered by `subordinate_id` (specialists first, 'commander' last).
- Map `subordinate_id` to display names: "vanguard" → "Vanguard", "scout" → "Scout", etc.
- Map `subordinate_id` to role descriptions: "vanguard" → "Military Specialist", etc.
- `territories_referenced` aggregates all territory IDs from all subordinates' and commander's `actions_taken` JSON.
- If `subordinate_id` is missing on older rows, treat as "commander".
- Intel threshold check (3 effective agents) remains unchanged from Slice 3.
- `insufficient_intel` and `no_recent_reasoning` statuses remain unchanged from Slice 2.

### 4.6 New Reducer: `dismiss_strategist_alert(notification_id: INT)`

```rust
#[spacetimedb(reducer)]
fn dismiss_strategist_alert(notification_id: i32) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Find the strategist_log row with this id
    // Set dismissed = true
    // Return success
}
```

### 4.7 New Scheduled Reducer: `strategist_cycle()`

**Schedule:** Every 60 seconds. First fire at 50 seconds from game start (use an initial delay of 50000ms).

**Logic:**
1. Build full game state snapshot.
2. Construct prompt:

```
You are the Strategist, an AI advisor for the human player in Risk: Dominion. The player is player_id 1. You are on their side. Analyze the current game state and identify:

1. THREATS — What should the player be worried about?
2. OPPORTUNITIES — Where can the player gain an advantage?
3. WEAKNESSES — Where is the player vulnerable?

Return ONLY a JSON array of notifications. Each notification: {"notification": "Your advice here. Be concise and actionable.", "priority": "critical|warning|info", "territory_id": N or null}. Limit to 3 notifications total. Prioritize critical threats first.

Current game state:
{full_game_state_snapshot}
```

3. Spawn thread. Call Claude. Temperature: 0.3. Max tokens: 300. Timeout: 15 seconds.
4. Parse JSON array. For each notification, insert into `strategist_log`.
5. On timeout or error: do nothing.

**Position:** Top-right area of the screen, below ActionBar. Stacked vertically.

**Props:** `alerts: StrategistLogRow[]`, `onDismiss: (id: number) => void`, `onAlertClick: (territoryId: number | null) => void`.

**Rendering:**
- Filter: only alerts where `dismissed === false`. Show most recent 3.
- Each alert is a card with `bg-surface` (#1A1A2E), border-left 3px solid:
  - `critical`: `#FF4444` with subtle CSS pulse animation on the border.
  - `warning`: `#FF8844`.

- If `territory_id` is not null, clicking the card body calls `onAlertClick(alert.territory_id)`.
- Cards stack vertically with 4px gaps. Newest at top.
- Animate in: slide from right over 200ms ease-out.

### 7.5 `ActionCard.tsx` (MODIFIED)

  - Render each deliberation entry as a section:
    - Header: subordinate_name + role in Orbitron, 11px, player color.
    - Body: reasoning text in JetBrains Mono, 11px, `text-primary`.
  - Entries separated by 0.5px divider in `#334455`.
  - Commander entry rendered last, with slightly larger font or bold weight.
  - Scrollable if content exceeds panel height.
- Fallback: if `deliberation` is missing (older data), display `intel_text` as before.

### 7.8 `Map.tsx` (MODIFIED)

**Props:** Add `selectedTerritory: number | null`, `ownedTerritoriesHighlighted: boolean`, `playerId: number`.

**Rendering:**
- `selectedTerritory`: render a bright white or gold outline (2px, `#FFFFFF` or `#FFD700`) around the selected territory hex. Distinct from query highlights and ticker highlights.
- `ownedTerritoriesHighlighted`: when true, apply subtle gold glow to all territories where the player owns at least one dimension. When false, normal rendering.

### 7.9 `App.tsx` (MODIFIED)

**New state:**
```typescript
const [selectedTerritory, setSelectedTerritory] = useState<number | null>(null);
const [focusedCardType, setFocusedCardType] = useState<'military' | 'economic' | 'covert' | null>(null);
const [ownedTerritoriesHighlighted, setOwnedTerritoriesHighlighted] = useState(false);
```

**Keyboard event handler:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    // Suppress hotkeys when query bar is focused (except Tab, Escape, Enter)
    if (document.activeElement?.tagName === 'INPUT') {
      if (!['Tab', 'Escape', 'Enter'].includes(e.key)) return;
    }
    
    switch (e.key) {
      case '1': setFocusedCardType('military'); break;
      case '2': setFocusedCardType('economic'); break;
      case '3': setFocusedCardType('covert'); break;
      case 'w': case 'W': case 'ArrowUp': moveCursor('up'); break;
      case 'a': case 'A': case 'ArrowLeft': moveCursor('left'); break;
      case 's': case 'S': case 'ArrowDown': moveCursor('down'); break;
      case 'd': case 'D': case 'ArrowRight': moveCursor('right'); break;
      case 'Enter': case ' ': confirmAction(); e.preventDefault(); break;
      case 'Escape': clearSelection(); break;
      case 'q': case 'Q': focusQueryBar(); break;
      case 'i': case 'I': toggleIntelPanel(); break;
      case 'c': case 'C': cycleIntelTarget(); break;
      case 'h': case 'H': setOwnedTerritoriesHighlighted(prev => !prev); break;
    }
  };
  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  return () => document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
}, [selectedTerritory, focusedCardType, /* other deps */]);
```

**`moveCursor` function:** Compute the nearest territory in the pressed direction using `HEX_GRID_COORDINATES`. Find the territory with the closest Euclidean distance that is in the correct direction (higher y for down, lower y for up, lower x for left, higher x for right). If no territory is selected, default to territory 1.

**`confirmAction` function:** If `focusedCardType` and `selectedTerritory` are both set, validate that the territory is a valid target for the card type (adjacency for Military, any for Economic and Covert). Call the appropriate reducer. Clear selection after.

**`clearSelection` function:** Set `focusedCardType = null`, `selectedTerritory = null`, close any open panels.

**`focusQueryBar` function:** Call `.focus()` on the query input element (use a ref).

**`toggleIntelPanel` function:** Toggle intel panel open/closed state.

**`cycleIntelTarget` function:** Cycle through AI player IDs: 2 → 3 → 4 → null (close).

**Layout changes:** Add `StrategistAlerts` component in top-right area, below ActionBar.

**Pass props:**
- `StrategistAlerts`: `alerts={strategistLog}`, `onDismiss`, `onAlertClick`.
- `Map`: `selectedTerritory`, `ownedTerritoriesHighlighted`, `playerId`.
- `ActionCard`: `hotkeyNumber` based on card type.
- `IntelPanel`: `hotkeyHint={true}`.

## 8. GENERATION RULES

1. **Modify existing files in place.** Read each file before modifying. Preserve all Slice 4 functionality not explicitly changed.
2. **Mark every output file** as MODIFIED or NEW at the top.
3. **Replace `ai_reasoning_cycle` body entirely.** Do not preserve old single-call logic.
4. **All arithmetic is integer arithmetic.** No floats.
5. **SpacetimeDB macros:** `#[spacetimedb(table)]`, `#[spacetimedb(reducer)]`, `#[spacetimedb(scheduled)]`.
6. **Tailwind CSS for all styling.** Use design tokens from `../AESTHETIC.md`.
7. **No emojis. No em dashes. No custom CSS files.**
8. **Thread synchronization:** Use `std::thread::spawn` and `JoinHandle::join()`. Wrap joins with timeout logic.
9. **Handle missing `subordinate_id`** on older `ai_reasoning_log` rows by treating them as `"commander"`.
10. **This is the final slice.** Generate everything specified. No placeholders.

## 9. WHAT NOT TO GENERATE

There are no future slices. Generate everything specified. Do not add:
- New dimensions
- New AI opponents
- New card types
- New gameplay mechanics beyond orchestration and hotkeys

## 10. SUCCESS CRITERIA

After applying all modifications, the Slice 5 application must:

1. **Compile** — `cargo build` for server, `npm run build` for client. Zero errors.
2. **Run orchestrated AI cycles** — All three AIs complete cycles with commander + 4 specialists. First cycle up to 120s, subsequent cycles faster.
3. **Show deliberation chain in intel** — Full subordinate reasoning visible. Commander synthesis last.
4. **Display Strategist alerts** — Notifications appear at 50s and every 60s. Color-coded by priority. Dismissable.
5. **Respond to all hotkeys** — 1/2/3 for cards, WASD/arrows for cursor, Enter/Space to confirm, Escape to clear, Q/I/C/H for panels.
6. **Suppress hotkeys in query bar** — Typing works normally. Escape exits. Hotkeys resume.
7. **Render selection cursor** — White/gold outline on selected territory. Distinct from other highlights.
8. **Show hotkey hints** — Small squares on cards (1,2,3), query bar (Q), Intel panel (I).
9. **Preserve all Slice 4 functionality** — Gameplay, queries, ticker unchanged.

## End of Slice 5 Masterplan

Read the existing Slice 4 codebase. Apply every modification specified above in the order specified. Output every changed file with MODIFIED or NEW at the top. This is the final slice. After generation, Risk: Dominion is complete. Generate now.
